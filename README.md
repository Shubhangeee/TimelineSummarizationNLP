Create a timeline summary or list that highlights the major events of the Israel-Hamas war during the specified time period from the JSON file. 
The JSON file contains 37,000 news articles from various sources covering the Israel-Hamas conflict. 
These articles span from October 2023 to March 2024. However, not all articles focus on the Israel-Hamas war; some are unrelated and discuss different topics.
Additionally, since the data was scraped from the web, the articles may include noise such as punctuation, special characters, and irrelevant symbols.
A timeline summarization basically details the major events that had taken place during a particular time-period.
An example: 7 October – 27 October 2023: Initial attacks 28 October – 23 November 2023: Invasion of the Gaza Strip 24 November 2023 – 11 January 2024: First ceasefire 12 January 2024 – 6 May 2024: Yemen airstrikes 7 May 2024 – present: Rafah offensive
